		  	<p class="synopsis"> <span class="intro">“Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.”</span><br>

		  	 So begins the series, set in a fantasy world split into four nations based on each element: water, earth, fire, and air. In this world, gifted people, known as benders, have the ability to manipulate the elements. Only one person has the ability to bend all the elements, and this person is the Avatar - tasked with keeping the world in balance. The Avatar is cyclically reincarnated as a citizen of each of the four nations in turn.<br>
		  	 <br>
		  	 When the series begins, the world has been at war against the Fire Nation for a hundred years. The Avatar has been missing for all that time, having disappeared without a trace just before the start of the war. Only a child when he was informed of his role and responsibilities, twelve-year-old Aang had fled his home, inadvertently avoiding the attack that would wipe out his people and leave him as the last Airbender. While running away, he gets caught in a storm, and winds up becoming frozen in a sort of stasis for a century. With his return to the world, a child still, it’s up to him to complete his training to become a full-fledged Avatar, master all the elements, and restore harmony to the world.<br>
		  	 <br>
		  	 Avatar was co-created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. It ran on Nickelodeon from February 2005 to July 2008. Some comics and books have been published to fill the space between seasons and series. <!-- No full-length film has ever been made. --><br>
		  	 <br>
		  	 The series is heavily influenced by Asian culture, from animation to mythology to martial arts. Each bending style is choreographed based on a real-world style: the creators drew inspiration from Baguazhang for airbending, Hung Gar for earthbending, Northern Shaolin for firebending, and Tai Chi for waterbending. The show employed consultants for culture, calligraphy, and martial arts to get the Asian-influenced details right.</p>
